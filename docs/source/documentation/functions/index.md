# Functions
Here we can find the documentation for the routines implemented in the Combustion Toolbox, which are organized in three different folders:
   * ```modules```: this folder contains routines that solve different types of problems implemented in the three main routines of CT (CT-EQUIL, CT-SD, and CT-ROCKET).
   * ```utils```: this folder contains a collection of functions that have multiple purposes (utilities, database, display, equation of state, export, extensions, root finding algorithms, thermo, and validations).
   * ```gui```: This folder contains all the functions and assets required to generate the app (GUI), add-ons, and extend the functionality of the plain code to the GUI.

```{warning}
Please note that the documentation is currently under development.

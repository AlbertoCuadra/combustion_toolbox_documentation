# Functions

Here we can find the documentation for the routines implemented in the Combustion Toolbox, which are organized in three different subfolders:

* ```databases```: contains all the databases used by CT.
* ```examples```: contains examples showcasing the usage of CT modules.
* ```gui```: contains all the functions and assets required to generate the app (GUI), add-ons, and extend the functionality of the plain code to the GUI.
* ```installer```: folder with the installation files (app, toolbox, and package).
* ```modules```: contains routines that solve different types of problems implemented in the three main routines of CT (CT-EQUIL, CT-SD, and CT-ROCKET).
* ```utils```: contains a collection of functions that have multiple purposes (utilities, database, display, equation of state, export, extensions, root finding algorithms, thermo, and validations).
* ```validations```: folder with all the validations of CT with other codes and artifacts (for tests automatization).

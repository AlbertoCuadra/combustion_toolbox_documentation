# Basics

In this section we will cover the basic functionalities of the Combustion Toolbox (CT). 


A brief summary of the main steps required to solve a problem with CT:
1. Initialize CT (load databases, set default variables, etc.).
2. Define the initial state (temperature, pressure, composition).
3. Set chemical system (species that can appear in the chemical transformations).
4. Select the problem type (e.g., an adibatic isobaric combustion).
5. Define additional parameters (depends on the problem selected).
6. Solve the problem.
7. Plot the results.

# Basics

In this section we will cover the basic functionalities of the Combustion Toolbox (CT). 


Briefly, the main steps required to solve a problem with CT are as follows:
1. Define database.
2. Set chemical system (species that can appear in the chemical transformations).
3. Define the initial mixture (temperature, pressure, and composition).
4. Select the solver depending of the problem type (e.g., for an adibatic isobaric combustion this is EquilibriumSolver).
5. Define additional parameters (depends on the problem selected).
6. Solve the problem.
7. Plot the results.

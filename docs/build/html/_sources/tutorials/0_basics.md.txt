# Basics

In this section, we will cover the basic functionalities of the Combustion Toolbox (CT).


Briefly, the main steps required to solve a problem with CT are as follows:
1. Define the database.
2. Set the chemical system (species that may appear in the thermochemical transformations).
3. Define the initial mixture (temperature, pressure, and composition).
4. Select the solver based on the problem type.
5. Define additional parameters (depending on the problem selected).
6. Solve the problem.
7. Plot the results.

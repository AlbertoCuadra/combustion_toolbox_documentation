# Chemical equilibrium at constant temperature and pressure

As a first example, let's compute the equilibrium composition of a stoichiometric CH$_4$-ideal air mixture at 3000 K and 1.01325 bar (1 atm). To obtain the equilibrium composition, we have to define the chemical species that can appear in the final state. The combustion of typical hydrocarbon fuels, such as methane, is a complex process that involves hundreds of chemical species. However, the number of species that have a significant impact on the properties of the final mixture is much smaller. Combustion Toolbox provides a list of predefined species that can be used to compute the equilibrium composition of a mixture. The list of predefined species can be found in the routine `list_species.m`.

For a preliminary analysis, we will consider a set of 24 species:

* CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O, H$_2$, O$_2$, N$_2$, C<sub>gr</sub>,
* C$_2$, C$_2$H$_4$, CH, CH, CH$_3$, CH$_4$, CN, H,
* HCN, HCO, N, NH, NH$_2$, NH$_3$, NO, O, OH,
  
which typically appear in the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels with air. This set of species is defined in the routine `list_species.m` as `Soot formation`, which also includes He and Ar. 


## Defining chemical system

``````{tab-item} Plain code

To initialize the Combustion Toolbox (CT) with this set of species, type the following at the MATLAB prompt:

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} Predefined list of species
```matlab
self = App('Soot formation');
```
````

````{tab-item} Specifiying a custom list of species
```matlab
self = App({'CO2', 'CO', 'H2O', 'H2', 'O2', 'N2', 'Cbgrb', ...
            'C2', 'C2H4', 'CH', 'CH', 'CH3', 'CH4', 'CN', 'H', ...
            'HCN', 'HCO', 'N', 'NH', 'NH2', 'NH3', 'NO', 'O', 'OH'});

## Setting the initial thermodynamic state
```````{tab-set}
``````{tab-item} Plain code
To indicate the temperature [K] and pressure [bar] of the initial mixture, type:
```matlab
self = set_prop(self, 'TR', 300, 'pR', 1 * 1.01325);
```

## Setting the initial chemical composition



```````{tab-set}
``````{tab-item} Plain code
To indicate the species and chemical composition in the initial mixture:
`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} Individual study
For a stochiometric CH$_4$-ideal air mixture:
```matlab
self.PD.S_Fuel     = {'CH4'};
self.PD.N_Fuel     = 1;
self.PD.S_Oxidizer = {'N2', 'O2'};
self.PD.N_Oxidizer = [7.52, 2];
```

This is the same as specifying a unit value for the equivalence ratio:
```matlab
self.PD.S_Fuel     = {'CH4'};
self.PD.S_Oxidizer = {'N2', 'O2'};
self.PD.ratio_oxidizers_O2 = [79, 21]/21;
self = set_prop(self, 'phi', 1);
```

The last two lines of code establish the proportion of the oxidizers species over O$_2$ and the equivalence ratio, respectively. The number of moles are calculated considering that the number of moles of fuel is one by default.
````

````{tab-item} Parametric study
For a lean-to-rich CH$_4$-ideal air mixtures:
```matlab
self.PD.S_Fuel     = {'CH4'};
self.PD.S_Oxidizer = {'N2', 'O2'};
self.PD.ratio_oxidizers_O2 = [79, 21]/21;
self = set_prop(self, 'phi', 0.5:0.01:4);
```

The last two lines of code establish the proportion of the oxidizers species over O$_2$ and the equivalence ratio, respectively. The number of moles are calculated considering that the number of moles of fuel is one by default.

## Set chemical transformation 

```````{tab-set}
``````{tab-item} Plain code
Depending on the problem you want to solve, you may need to configure additional inputs. In this case, to compute the equilibrium composition at the defined temperature and pressure (TP), we have to set these values as
```matlab
self = set_prop(self, 'pP', self.PD.pR.value, 'TP', 3000);
```

```{note}
Here, the pressure of the final state has been defined using the defined value of the initial state, `self.PD.pR.value`.

The results are contained in `self.PS`. By default, `solve_problem.m` prints the results through the command window, which gives for the stoichiometric case (phi=1):

# Functions
Here we can find the documentation for the routines implemented in Combustion Toolbox, which are divided in three different folders:
   * ```utils```: folder with a collection of functions with multiple purposes (utilities, database, display, equation of state, export, extensions, root finding algorithms, thermo, and validations).
   * ```modules```: routines to solve the different type of problems implemented in the three routines that compound CT (CT-EQUIL, CT-SD, and CT-ROCKET).
   * ```gui```: folder with all the functions to generate the app, add-ons, assets, and all the necessary functions to be compatible with the plain code and extend its functionality.

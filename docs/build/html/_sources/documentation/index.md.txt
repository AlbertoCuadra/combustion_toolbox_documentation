# Directory tree
The directory tree of Combustion Toolbox (CT) is organized as follows:
   * ```databases```: folder with all the databases.
   * ```examples```: folder with all the examples.
   * ```gui```: folder with all the functions to generate the app, add-ons, assets, and all the necessary functions to be compatible with the plain code and extend its functionality.
   * ```installer```: folder with the installation files (app, toolbox, and package).
   * ```modules```: routines to solve the different type of problems implemented in the three routines that compound CT (CT-EQUIL, CT-SD, and CT-ROCKET).
   * ```utils```: folder with a collection of functions with multiple purposes (utilities, database, display, equation of state, export, extensions, root finding algorithms, thermo, and validations).
   * ```validations```: folder with all the validations of CT with other codes and artifacts (for tests automatization).

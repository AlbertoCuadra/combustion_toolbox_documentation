# Shocks and detonations waves

In this section, you will find the documentation of the routines implemented to obtain the pre-shock and post-shock states of a set of fluid dynamic problems related with the shock waves and detonations waves.

```{note}
The kernel of the incident, reflected, and Chapman-Jouguet detonations are based on Gordon, S., & McBride, B. J. (1994). NASA reference publication, 1311.
